About Me
I am Atharv Roday, a student pursuing Economics from IITB. I have a deep passion to learn and
explore new things.
Beyond the lecture halls and textbooks, I thrive on engaging in co-curricular activities that 
fuel my curiosity and creativity. I love to play sports: Cricket, Basketball, Badminton, 
Volleyball, you name it! (There's a high chance I'll beat you at most of them)

At the core of everything I do is a relentless passion for learning. From the pages of 
textbooks to the lessons hidden within everyday experiences, I approach each day with an 
insatiable curiosity and a hunger for knowledge that knows no bounds.

For me, learning isn't just about acquiring facts and figures; it's about embracing the joy of 
discovery, the thrill of exploration, and the satisfaction of mastering new skills

Economics isn't just a subject for meâ€”it's a lens through which I view the world and 
a powerful tool for understanding the intricate web of forces that shape our lives. From the 
invisible hand of the market to the complex interplay of supply and demand, I'm captivated by 
the way economics offers insights into the behavior of individuals, businesses, and entire 
societies.
